## [Unreleased] 2022-07-28

As DFO has a naming system in place, their Station_Event_IDs - and consequently, also the Catch_IDs and Specimen_IDs - are constructed slightly differently.
Whilst properly nested, some changes were made to the columns to facilitate construction of Station_Event_IDs, Catch_IDs and Specimen_IDs that follow the IYS format.
This should improve interoperability with other trawl and specimen from the other vessels.

### Changed
- In sheet '3. SAMPLING EVENT INFO': Original Station_Event_ID column renamed to 'DFO_Station_Event_ID'
- In sheet '4. CATCH_FINAL INFO': Original Station_Event_ID and Catch_ID columns renamed to 'DFO_Station_Event_ID' and 'DFO_Catch_ID' respectively
- In sheet '5. SPECIMEN INFO': Original Station_Event_ID, Catch_ID and Specimen_ID columns renamed to 'DFO_Station_Event_ID', 'DFO_Catch_ID' and 'DFO_Specimen_ID', respectively.
- In all sheets, CCGS Franklin was replaced by 'Franklin'. 
- In sheet '4. CATCH_FINAL INFO': Hormiphora cucumisÂ in column 'Scientific_Name' was changed to "Hormiphora cucumis"

- In sheet '4. CATCH_FINAL INFO': Column 'SpeciesID' created to facilitate construction of Catch_ID.
