# Changelog for IYS_2022_FRANKLIN

All notable changes to the IYS_2022_FRANKLIN will be documented in this file.

The changes made between versions / releases are documented below.

## [Unreleased] 2023-02-23

### Changed
- In sheet '6. CTD INFO': '_Rosette' was appended and the dash between IYS and 2022 was removed to match the Station_Event_ID values to match the format in the Sampling Event Info tab

## Notes:

The original data template file (first version: IYS_2022_FRANKLIN_Bridge_Catch_Specimen.xlsx) is stored in the original_data folder, in the 'archived' folder.
The second version received (IYS_2022_FRANKLIN_V2.0_20220928.xlsx) has been stored in the original_data folder. 

The second version was populated by A. Tabata (DFO) on top of the amended file, and so includes the initial changes made between the first version and the IYS_2022_FRANKLIN.
These initial changes are logged under "## [Unreleased] 2022-07-28". 

The changes made between the amended first version and the second version are included below: "## [Unreleased] 2022-09-28", and are also included in the second version (IYS_2022_FRANKLIN_V2.0_20220928.xlsx), under the tab "AT Changes 20220928".

The file `IYS_2022_FRANKLIN` continues to be the file that contains the latest version received from the data provider.

## [Unreleased] 2022-07-28

As DFO has a naming system in place, their Station_Event_IDs - and consequently, also the Catch_IDs and Specimen_IDs - are constructed slightly differently.
Whilst properly nested, some changes were made to the columns to facilitate construction of Station_Event_IDs, Catch_IDs and Specimen_IDs that follow the IYS format.
This should improve interoperability with other trawl and specimen from the other vessels.

### Changed
- In sheet '3. SAMPLING EVENT INFO': Original Station_Event_ID column renamed to 'DFO_Station_Event_ID'
- In sheet '4. CATCH_FINAL INFO': Original Station_Event_ID and Catch_ID columns renamed to 'DFO_Station_Event_ID' and 'DFO_Catch_ID' respectively
- In sheet '5. SPECIMEN INFO': Original Station_Event_ID, Catch_ID and Specimen_ID columns renamed to 'DFO_Station_Event_ID', 'DFO_Catch_ID' and 'DFO_Specimen_ID', respectively.
- In all sheets, CCGS Franklin was replaced by 'Franklin'. 
- In sheet '4. CATCH_FINAL INFO': Hormiphora cucumisÂ in column 'Scientific_Name' was changed to "Hormiphora cucumis"
- In sheet '3. SAMPLING EVENT INFO': For station 51-132, the bottom_depth_meters was changed to 2684 as per comm. with Amy Tabata. This was the modal bottom depth across the trawl, with the depth at the start being 2810 m, and at the end 2615 m. 

### Added
- In sheet '3. SAMPLING EVENT INFO': Column 'Cruise_name' added, populated with "IYS2022"
- In sheet '3. SAMPLING EVENT INFO': Column "Station_Event_ID" created, populated following the IYS format (i.e. IYS2022-CCGS Franklin-5-48-138-Trawl)
- In sheet '4. CATCH_FINAL INFO': Columns Station_Event_ID and Catch_ID created following the IYS format (i.e. for Catch_ID: IYS2022-CCGS Franklin-5-50-135-Trawl-3R5)
- In sheet '4. CATCH_FINAL INFO': Column 'SpeciesID' created to facilitate construction of Catch_ID. 
- In sheet '5. SPECIMEN INFO': Columns Station_Event_ID, Catch_ID and Specimen_ID created following the IYS format (i.e. for Specimen_ID: IYS2022-CCGS Franklin-5-50-135-Trawl-3XU-0001)
- In sheet '5. SPECIMEN INFO': Column 'SpecimenID' created to facilitate construction of the Specimen_ID.
